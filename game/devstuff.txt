each character has stamina and motivation

motivation: 0
stamina: 100

things you gotta take care off:
-argument
-story
-gameplay
-characters
-backgrounds
-music
-pre-launch buzz

each aspect of the game will have X steps, and depending on your stamina/motivation you'll have to cut corners on some of them. You can redo previous aspects, as well; but it wastes time. You can also use items on people or talk to them to improve their motivation/stamina and ask them to do stuff.
